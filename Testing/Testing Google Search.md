# How would you test Google search?

_depends on what is required, as Google Search can do *many* things_

- For example, do you want to test the UI?
- do you want to do mobile based tests?

Google Search can be broken up into several sections:

- UI Functional Tests
  - Accessibility Testing (up to WCAG Tests)
  - UI string searching
- Functional Tests
  - String matching
    - expected mathematical expression returns desired results
